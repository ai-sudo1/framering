# Frame Ring

Just a good old fashioned web ring but with farcaster frames ^-^

Instructions:

1. Fork this FrameRing repo and import it into a new Vercel project

2. Set your project domain to framering-#.vercel.app â€“ where # is the your place in the ring.* 

3. Create a 1200x630px png to use as your frame image. Call it image.png and put it to the /public folder, overwriting the one that's in there.

4. Open the constants.ts file in the /constants folder and change the numbers in the paths to reflect your place in the ring.

5. Commit your changes, deploy, and that's it!

Have fun on the internet

*For instance, framering-0.vercel.app is the first in the ring. The next frame is framering-1.vercel.app, taken by elle as the first example. If you are prevented from using a number, it means someone is already in that spot so choose the next number. You may also choose a number farther down the line and wait/hope for the ring to reach your spot.
